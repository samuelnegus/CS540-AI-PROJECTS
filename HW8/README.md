# HW8: Funny Puzzle Solver

This project implements a solver for a variant of the 8-tile puzzle using the A* search algorithm. The puzzle operates on a 3x3 grid with fewer than 8 tiles, with empty spaces represented by `0`. The objective is to arrange the tiles in ascending order with the empty spaces at the bottom-right corner of the grid.
